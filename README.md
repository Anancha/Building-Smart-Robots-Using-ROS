# Building Smart Robots Using ROS

This is the repository for [Building Smart Robots Using ROS
](https://bpbonline.com/products/building-smart-robots-using-ros?_pos=1&_sid=a0512eff2&_ss=r),published by BPB Publications. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the journey of this book.
## About the Book
This book is a practical introduction to the Robotics operating system (ROS). It will expose you to the essential principles, tools, and packages in ROS and assist you in configuring and recombining components for additional tasks. If you are new to the world of robotics, you will enjoy the companionship of this book as it guides you through the process of building your first robot.

The book introduces robotics and advances through numerous concepts such as sensors and actuators, SLAM, Aruco markers, CAD (computer-aided design), React native application development, image processing in ROS, machine learning and object detection. Every point raised above is illustrated in a live robotics environment. Along the way, other packages required for developing ROS apps will be presented, including serial, OpenCV, and cv bridge. You'll learn about tools like SolidWorks, Moveit, Rviz, as well as simulation platforms like gazebo and turtlesim, which will give you a complete picture of what it takes to build a robot.

This book presents an in-depth examination of Robot Operating Systems (ROS), the sole foundation for developing robotics applications. The book guides the readers through investigating and embedding machine learning code to introduce intelligence into the robot.
